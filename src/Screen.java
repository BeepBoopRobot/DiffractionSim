BRIEF: This object is designed to get the average of the wave "energy" values that reach it.
I need to think how I will do this.
It will then return these values to the screen visualiser.
The reason I do the average is so that it can charge up and move smoothly, similar to how glow-in-the-dark things charge up
it'll look pretty.
